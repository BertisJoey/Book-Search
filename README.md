# Book-Search
A book search engine originally created with a restful API adapted to an Apollo Server and GraphQL

## Description
This project was done in order to adapt a site that searches books from a restful API to GraphQL, and adapted to run on an Apollo Server. Some of the original code was left in and you can see where large parts are commented out.
This was done so that it can be seen what was originally in the code that is no longer needed, somethings like the routes on the server side were left in as they did not need to be commented out as the server was now pulling from the typeDefs and resolvers.
